Looking around the website, Admin Dashboard, didn't lead to anything interesting. The links did not work, and if you're
curious what the rest of the messages say, you can view the source code and read them (the cutest being from the good boy).

Gobuster gives an error that reads "Error: the server returns a status code that matches the provided options for non existing urls. 
http://10.10.80.90/b592112d-da5a-47da-bc2b-b61067df8718 => 200 (Length: 42131). To continue please exclude the status code, the length or use the 
--wildcard switch." Specifying 200 as a negative status code doesn't produce any other results.

I looked for exploits for PHP 8.1.0-dev and found this on exploit DB: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933

"PHP 8.1.0-dev - 'User-Agentt' Remote Code Execution"

Save the exploit, and run it:

python 49933.py            
Enter the full host url:
http://[machine IP]
